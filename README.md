Just a basic memory card game with Disney themed graphics. It has 3 skill levels (beginner, intermediate and advanced), with 6 levels per skill level. Each level uses a timer and card flip counter to determine the max time for that level and the max score.

Go to the gamesetup.js file to edit game parameters for medals and maximum amounts of time and card flips.
